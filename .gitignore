### 4. **.gitignore** File

The `.gitignore` file ensures that unnecessary or sensitive files are not tracked by Git (such as temporary files, build artifacts, and compiled binaries). Here's a basic `.gitignore` for C++ projects:

```txt
# Ignore build and temporary files
/build/
/*.o
/*.exe
/*.out
*.swp
*.bak
*.log

# Ignore IDE files (e.g., for Visual Studio, Xcode, etc.)
.vscode/
.idea/
CMakeCache.txt
CMakeFiles/
Makefile
